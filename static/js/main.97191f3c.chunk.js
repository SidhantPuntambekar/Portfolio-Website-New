During the First World War, Japan and the United States fought as members of the Allied Powers alongside Britain, France, and Russia (which withdrew in 1917), opposing the Central Powers comprising Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire. In the postwar settlements, Germany was compelled to pay reparations to the Allied nations, with the notable exceptions of Russia and Japan. Japan\'s marginalization during the Versailles conference, particularly regarding its proposed racial equality clause and territorial claims in East Asia and the Pacific, engendered a sense of resentment and betrayal among Japanese leadership.","Throughout the 1920s, Japan embarked on an aggressive program of military expansion and modernization, enhancing its army with new conscripts, commissioning faster, more heavily armed naval vessels, and developing an increasingly sophisticated air force. By the 1930s, as fascist ideologies gained ground in Europe, most notably with Adolf Hitler\'s rise to power in Germany, the balance of power within Japan shifted decisively from the civilian government and the Emperor toward a militarist oligarchy. The armed forces, dominated by generals and admirals, exercised de facto control over state policy, reducing Emperor Hirohito to a largely symbolic role in governance. Among the military figures who rose to prominence during this period was Hideki Tojo.","Born in 1884 in Tokyo\'s Kojimachi district, Tojo began his military career in 1905, participating in the final stages of the Russo-Japanese War. He steadily ascended the ranks, achieving the position of major general by 1934. Although he opposed the attempted coup d\u2019\xe9tat against the Emperor in 1936, Tojo remained a central figure in Japan\'s militarist regime.","Japan\'s imperial ambitions became manifest in its invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Under the leadership of generals such as Shigeru Honjo, Jir\u014d Tamon, and Senj\u016br\u014d Hayashi, Japanese forces rapidly occupied key territories. The 7th Division, consisting of approximately 61,000 troops, confronted an estimated 160,000 Chinese soldiers. The Jinzhou operation, conducted by Tamon, resulted in the capture of Jinzhou and, subsequently, Nanjing. This campaign significantly weakened the Chinese Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, and facilitated Japan\u2019s control over much of southern Manchuria. In early 1932, Tamon directed a northern offensive that seized the city of Harbin, completing Japan\u2019s occupation of the region.","In the aftermath, Ma Zhanshan, a prominent Chinese military leader in the north, was coerced into cooperating with the Japanese-established puppet regime in Manchuria. The invasion marked Japan\u2019s first major territorial expansion on the Asian mainland and served as a precursor to further aggression in East Asia and the Pacific. The swift and overwhelming nature of the campaign, reminiscent of later blitzkrieg tactics, caught Chinese forces unprepared and contributed to the eruption of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/history/manchuria_invasion/tojo.png","caption":"Tojo Hideki"},{"url":"/history/manchuria_invasion/shigeru.png","caption":"Shigeru Honjo"},{"url":"/history/manchuria_invasion/chiangkaishek.png","caption":"Chiang Kai-Shek"},{"url":"/history/manchuria_invasion/mazhanshan.png","caption":"Ma Zhanshan"},{"url":"/history/manchuria_invasion/invasionofmanchuria.png","caption":"Japanese Invasion of Manchuria"},{"url":"/history/manchuria_invasion/mukden.png","caption":"Japanese soldiers enter the city of Shenyang following the Mukden incident"},{"url":"/history/manchuria_invasion/senjuro.png","caption":"Senjuro Hayashi"},{"url":"/history/manchuria_invasion/jirotamon.png","caption":"Jiro Tamon"}]},{"id":2,"title":"Second Sino-Japanese War","date":"1939-1945","image":"/history/thumbnails/second_sino_japanese_war.png","content":["The Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 served as a prelude to the broader conflict of the Second Sino-Japanese War, which formally began in 1937 and endured until 1945. While historical tensions between China and Japan spanned centuries, this modern conflict was distinguished by its unprecedented scale, mechanization, and brutality, eclipsing earlier hostilities between the two nations. Following Japan\'s occupation of Manchuria\u2014a territory it would hold until the Soviet invasion in 1945\u2014the conflict escalated into full-scale warfare with major battles in key urban centers.","The hostilities intensified with Japan\'s seizure of cities such as Harbin and Shanghai. In response, Chinese Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek mobilized his forces to confront the Japanese presence, initiating a siege of the Japanese-controlled International Settlement in Shanghai. This confrontation rapidly evolved into the Battle of Shanghai, one of the earliest and most destructive urban engagements of the war. Chinese airstrikes targeted the settlement, prompting a forceful response from the Japanese Navy\'s carrier-based aviation units, which conducted sustained bombing campaigns against Chinese positions.","At the outset of the conflict, the Chinese Air Force, still reliant on largely obsolete World War I-era biplanes, was ill-equipped to counter the technologically superior Japanese forces. Japan\u2019s air power, represented by aircraft such as the Mitsubishi G4M Betty bomber and the Nakajima Ki-27 Nate fighter, quickly established aerial dominance. Recognizing the strategic necessity of maintaining supply lines from India and Burma to sustain Chinese resistance, Chiang Kai-shek sought international support.","This appeal led to collaboration with General Claire Lee Chennault, a retired officer of the United States Army Air Corps. Chennault organized and commanded the American Volunteer Group (AVG), later famously known as the Flying Tigers. Comprising American pilots flying Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, the AVG provided critical air support to Chinese forces. The unit achieved notable success, reportedly accounting for over 300 Japanese aircraft downed. Their unexpected effectiveness disrupted Japanese aerial operations in mainland China and represented one of the earliest instances of direct American involvement in the Pacific Theater, preceding the United States\u2019 formal entry into World War II.","A defining atrocity of the conflict was the Nanjing Massacre, also known as the Rape of Nanjing, which followed Japan\u2019s occupation of the Chinese capital in December 1937. Japanese troops perpetrated widespread atrocities, including mass executions, systematic sexual violence, and the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians. While estimates vary, contemporary scholarship places the number of victims between 40,000 and 300,000. International reporting of these events drew global condemnation and exposed the extent of Japanese militarist brutality, leaving a profound scar on modern Chinese historical memory and international relations in East Asia.","Simultaneously, the war exacerbated divisions within China\u2019s internal political landscape. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by Mao Zedong, and the Nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) under Chiang Kai-shek maintained an uneasy alliance against Japan but continued to vie for power. The conflict set the stage for the resumption of the Chinese Civil War after Japan\'s defeat in 1945, ultimately culminating in the Communist victory and the establishment of the People\'s Republic of China in 1949. The Second Sino-Japanese War, thus, not only served as a catalyst for major developments within China but also acted as a precursor to the broader Pacific War and reshaped geopolitical dynamics in East Asia for the decades to follow."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/history/second_sino_japanese_war/machinenest.png","caption":"Chinese Machine Gun Nest"},{"url":"/history/second_sino_japanese_war/chinesebiplane.png","caption":"Chinese Air Force Biplane"},{"url":"/history/second_sino_japanese_war/nate.png","caption":"Japanese Ki-27 Nate"},{"url":"/history/second_sino_japanese_war/clairechenault.png","caption":"Claire Lee Chennault"},{"url":"/history/second_sino_japanese_war/flyingtigers.png","caption":"Flying Tigers"},{"url":"/history/second_sino_japanese_war/nanking.png","caption":"Nanking after the Massacre"},{"url":"/history/second_sino_japanese_war/mao.png","caption":"A young Mao Zedong"}]},{"id":3,"title":"Japanese Moves In the Pacific","date":"1940-1942","image":"/history/thumbnails/japanese_moves_in_pacific.png","content":["Following its protracted military campaigns in China, Japan sought to extend its imperial dominion across East and Southeast Asia and the broader Pacific. As a resource-scarce island nation, Japan\u2019s economy and military apparatus were heavily dependent on the importation of critical raw materials, particularly oil, rubber, and metals, to sustain its industrial base and war effort. The strategic imperative to secure these resources, coupled with expansionist ambitions and the desire to assert its status as a dominant imperial power, drove Japanese militarists to pursue further territorial conquests throughout the region.","In 1940, Japan initiated a new phase of aggression by occupying Vichy-controlled French Indochina, encompassing the modern territories of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. The region had been developed by the French colonial administration into a valuable source of natural resources, including rubber, tea, and other commodities vital to Japan\u2019s war economy. This occupation, conducted with the tacit approval of Vichy France but under significant coercion, alarmed the Western colonial powers and marked a significant escalation in Japanese expansionism.","Shortly after this campaign, Japan formally withdrew from the League of Nations, an organization it had previously criticized as an instrument of Western imperialism, and solidified its alignment with fascist Europe by entering into the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy. This military alliance established the Axis Powers and laid the groundwork for a globally coordinated challenge to the Allied nations.","Subsequently, Japanese forces advanced into British Malaya, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia), territories rich in oil, rubber, and other strategic resources. Control over these colonies not only ensured Japan access to vital raw materials but also provided key naval and air bases from which it could launch further offensives against British India, Australia, and the island chains of the South Pacific.","In response to Japan\u2019s aggressive territorial expansion and occupation of European colonies in Southeast Asia, the United States, Britain, the Netherlands, Australia, and Free France imposed a comprehensive economic embargo on Japan. This embargo, particularly the restriction of oil exports, posed an existential threat to Japan\u2019s military operations and industrial economy, accelerating the crisis between Japan and the Western powers.","Faced with increasing diplomatic isolation and deteriorating access to essential resources, Japan continued to consolidate its territorial holdings, extending its control over the Caroline, Gilbert, Solomon, and Mariana Islands. These acquisitions fortified Japan\u2019s defensive perimeter and enhanced its capacity to project military power across the Pacific. By late 1941, both Japanese and Allied leaders recognized that armed conflict between Japan and the Western colonial powers had become inevitable, setting the stage for the outbreak of the Pacific War."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/history/japanese_moves_in_pacific/truk_lagoon.png","caption":"Truk Atoll in the Caroline Islands as a Japanese Base"},{"url":"/history/japanese_moves_in_pacific/japanese_in_saigon.png","caption":"Japanese forces entering Saigon in Vietnam"},{"url":"/history/japanese_moves_in_pacific/japanese_in_phillipines.png","caption":"Japanese forces move through the Philippines"},{"url":"/history/japanese_moves_in_pacific/japanese_expansion_map.png","caption":"Map of Japanese expansion in the Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia)"}]},{"id":4,"title":"Pearl Harbor","date":"December 7th, 1941","image":"/history/thumbnails/pearl_harbor.png","content":["On November 26, 1941, a Japanese naval strike force departed from the home islands of Japan, embarking on a clandestine operation to launch a surprise attack against the United States Pacific Fleet stationed at Pearl Harbor, in the Hawaiian Islands. The strategic objective of the operation was to cripple American naval power in the Pacific by destroying its battleships and, if possible, its aircraft carriers, thereby forestalling U.S. interference in Japan\u2019s planned offensives throughout Southeast Asia.","The attack force, under the overall command of Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, was composed of six fleet carriers\u2014Akagi, Kaga, Soryu, Hiryu, Shokaku, and Zuikaku\u2014accompanied by two battleships (Hiei and Kirishima), the heavy cruisers Tone and Chikuma, the light cruiser Abukuma, and nine destroyers. This formidable task force approached the waters north of Oahu undetected, arriving on December 6, 1941.","In the early morning hours of December 7, the Japanese prepared and launched the first wave of strike aircraft, consisting of 89 Nakajima B5N Kate torpedo bombers, 51 Aichi D3A Val dive bombers, and 43 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters. Although U.S. Army radar operators on Oahu detected the inbound formation, their reports were dismissed under the mistaken assumption that the aircraft were a scheduled flight of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers arriving from California.","At precisely 7:48 a.m. local time, the first wave commenced its assault on Pearl Harbor. The Kate torpedo bombers targeted the U.S. battleship force anchored along what was colloquially known as Battleship Row, while the Val dive bombers attacked nearby airfields at Hickam and Wheeler Army Air Fields in an effort to neutralize American air power. In the initial strike, the battleships USS Arizona and USS Utah were sunk, while the USS Nevada, attempting to escape the harbor under fire, was struck by multiple torpedoes and forced aground.","A second wave of Japanese aircraft followed soon after, inflicting further devastation. Additional battleships\u2014including Oklahoma, West Virginia, California, Tennessee, Maryland, and Pennsylvania\u2014were either sunk or severely damaged. The aerial assault effectively suppressed American air defenses, preventing any organized counterattack. By 1:00 p.m. local time, the Japanese strike groups had returned to their carriers, having achieved considerable tactical success.","However, a critical operational shortcoming of the attack was the absence of the U.S. Navy\u2019s aircraft carriers Enterprise, Lexington, and Saratoga, which were not present at Pearl Harbor during the raid. The survival of these carriers would prove decisive in the subsequent Pacific campaigns and constituted a significant strategic failure for Japan, whose naval doctrine heavily emphasized the importance of carrier-based operations.","In the immediate aftermath of the attack, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed Congress on December 8, 1941, famously declaring December 7: a date which will live in infamy. Congress swiftly passed a declaration of war against Japan, followed by similar resolutions against Germany and Italy, marking the United States\' official entry into the Second World War. The attack on Pearl Harbor thus not only transformed the conflict into a truly global war but also marked a turning point in modern military history, demonstrating the decisive power of carrier-based aviation in naval warfare."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/history/pearl_harbor/kate.png","caption":"A Kate torpedo bomber leaves aircraft carrier Shokaku"},{"url":"/history/pearl_harbor/pearl_harbor.png","caption":"Japanese planes attacking Pearl Harbor"},{"url":"/history/pearl_harbor/uss_arizona.png","caption":"USS Arizona sinking"},{"url":"/history/pearl_harbor/us_battleships.png","caption":"Three US Battleships on fire and sunk"},{"url":"/history/pearl_harbor/fdr.png","caption":"President Franklin D.

In early 1942, the Japanese dispatched a powerful carrier strike force under the command of Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo to conduct operations against British naval and air facilities along the coast of Ceylon (modern-day Sri Lanka), as well as key British positions at Singapore and Trincomalee. The objective of these raids was to eliminate British naval forces that might impede Japan\u2019s planned offensives into India, Burma, and potentially Australia, thereby expanding Japan\u2019s defensive perimeter and securing critical supply lines for its war effort.","Nagumo\u2019s task force was composed of six fleet carriers\u2014Akagi, Soryu, Hiryu, Shokaku, Zuikaku, and Ryujo\u2014supported by four battleships (Kongo, Hiei, Kirishima, and Haruna), five cruisers (Tone, Chikuma, Abukuma, Suzuya, and Kumano), and 19 destroyers. The fleet departed from the Celebes Islands and advanced westward into the Indian Ocean. Opposing them was the British Eastern Fleet under Admiral Sir James Somerville, divided into two principal formations: Force A, centered around the aircraft carriers HMS Formidable and HMS Indomitable, along with the battleship HMS Warspite; and Force B, consisting of HMS Hermes, four aging battleships (HMS Revenge, Royal Sovereign, Ramillies, and Resolution), and the cruisers HMS Cornwall and HMS Dorsetshire.","In early April 1942, Nagumo launched a series of coordinated air raids against British positions. On April 5, Japanese carrier-based dive bombers and torpedo bombers struck Colombo, destroying the destroyer HMS Tenedos and the armed merchant cruiser HMS Hector, while cruisers Kumano and Suzuya sank five merchant vessels in the harbor. Simultaneously, Japanese reconnaissance aircraft located elements of Force B, and a subsequent airstrike resulted in the sinking of HMS Hermes and its escort HMAS Vampire.","The following day, Nagumo\u2019s aircraft pursued and sank the cruisers HMS Cornwall and HMS Dorsetshire off the coast of the Maldives. After completing the operation at Colombo, the Japanese turned their attention to Trincomalee, where additional British merchant shipping was destroyed, further degrading British logistical capabilities in the region.","While the operation was a tactical success for the Japanese, resulting in the loss of significant British warships and merchant tonnage, Admiral Somerville\u2019s decision to withdraw the core of the Eastern Fleet preserved its main strike assets for future operations. The psychological impact of these raids, coupled with Japan\u2019s demonstrated ability to project carrier-based power deep into the Indian Ocean, compelled the British to avoid direct confrontation in subsequent engagements, including the Bombing of Darwin and the early phases of the Guadalcanal Campaign.","The Indian Ocean raids marked the zenith of Japanese naval power in 1942, but also revealed the vulnerabilities inherent in overextended supply lines and the strategic challenges posed by prolonged engagements on multiple fronts. These operations served to delay Allied counteroffensives in the region but failed to achieve a decisive, war-altering blow against British naval power, as the Eastern Fleet would later recover and play a supporting role in the Indian Ocean theater."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/history/first_indian_ocean_raid/first_indian_ocean_raid.png","caption":"Map of the First Indian Ocean Raid"},{"url":"/history/first_indian_ocean_raid/fast_carrier_attack_force.png","caption":"Japanese Fast Aircraft Carrier Force (Kido Butai)"},{"url":"/history/first_indian_ocean_raid/cornwall_and_dorsetshire.png","caption":"HMS Cornwall and HMS Dorsetshire under attack"},{"url":"/history/first_indian_ocean_raid/japanese_attack_colombo.png","caption":"Japanese aircraft prepare to attack Colombo"}]},{"id":6,"title":"The Doolittle Raid","date":"April 18th, 1942","image":"/history/thumbnails/doolittle_raid.png","content":["The Doolittle Raid, conducted on April 18, 1942, marked the first American airstrike against the Japanese home islands during World War II and served as a crucial morale-boosting operation for the United States in the early months of the Pacific War. In the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, American military and civilian morale reached a nadir, as Japanese forces rapidly expanded their control over the western Pacific. In response, U.S. naval leadership, in collaboration with the Army Air Forces, conceived a bold plan to strike directly at Tokyo and other industrial centers on the Japanese mainland.","The operation, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James Jimmy Doolittle, involved launching sixteen North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers from the aircraft carrier USS Hornet (CV-8)\u2014a feat unprecedented in naval aviation due to the bomber\u2019s size and range requirements. The raid was supported by a naval task force under Admiral William F. Halsey, which included the aircraft carriers USS Enterprise (CV-6) and USS Hornet, heavy cruisers USS Northampton, Vincennes, Salt Lake City, and Nashville, and eight destroyers.","The task force maintained strict radio silence as it approached the Japanese home islands. On the morning of April 18, however, the fleet was spotted by the Japanese picket boat Nitt\u014d Maru, which was quickly sunk by gunfire from USS Nashville. Concerned that the vessel had transmitted the task force\'s position, Admiral Mark Mitscher ordered the immediate launch of the bombers from a distance of approximately 750 nautical miles from Japan\u2014farther than originally planned. This increased the risk to both the aircrews and the success of the mission, as it left the bombers with insufficient fuel to reach predesignated landing sites in Nationalist-controlled China.","At 08:20 local time, the sixteen B-25s took off from the 467-foot flight deck of USS Hornet in challenging sea conditions. Although none of the aircraft had previously attempted a carrier takeoff, all managed to become airborne. The bombers proceeded to strike industrial and military targets in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Yokosuka, and Nagoya, inflicting light material damage but generating significant psychological impact.","After completing their bombing runs, the crews flew westward toward China. Most of the aircraft ultimately crash-landed or ditched in Chinese territory, with the assistance of local civilians and Nationalist forces, though several airmen were captured by Japanese troops. One aircraft, piloted by Captain Edward York, diverted to the Soviet Union, where the crew was interned due to the Soviet\u2013Japanese neutrality pact.","While the physical damage inflicted by the Doolittle Raid was minor and had no meaningful effect on Japanese industrial capacity, the operation achieved its principal objective: bolstering American morale in the wake of numerous early-war setbacks. Moreover, it demonstrated the capability of U.S. carrier forces to project power deep into Japanese territory. Strategically, the raid also contributed to Japanese military leadership\u2019s decision to accelerate plans for the Battle of Midway, in an effort to eliminate the perceived threat of American aircraft carriers. In this sense, the Doolittle Raid played a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of the Pacific War, serving both as a psychological victory for the United States and as a precursor to Japan\u2019s strategic overextension in the months that followed."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/history/doolittle_raid/doolittle_on_hornet.png","caption":"Colonel Doolittle and his B-25 flight crew aboard Hornet"},{"url":"/history/doolittle_raid/hornet_and_task_force.png","caption":"Hornet with her task force and the B-25s"},{"url":"/history/doolittle_raid/enterprise_fanning.png","caption":"USS Fanning escorting USS Enterprise on the Doolittle Raid"},{"url":"/history/doolittle_raid/doolittle_chinese.png","caption":"Doolittle and his men with the Chinese"},{"url":"/history/doolittle_raid/doolittle_fdr.png","caption":"Doolittle receiving the Medal of Honor"},{"url":"/history/doolittle_raid/b_25_hornet.png","caption":"A B-25 lifts off from the carrier USS Hornet for Japan"},{"url":"/history/doolittle_raid/la_times.png","caption":"Los Angeles Times headline about the Doolittle Raid"},{"url":"/history/doolittle_raid/nitto_maru.png","caption":"Nitto Maru sinking after hits from US cruiser USS Nashville"}]},{"id":7,"title":"Battle of the Coral Sea","date":"May 4th - 8th, 1942","image":"/history/thumbnails/battle_of_the_coral_sea.png","content":["The Battle of the Coral Sea, fought between May 4\u20138, 1942, marked the first naval engagement in history in which opposing ships never directly sighted or fired upon one another, with all offensive operations conducted by carrier-based aircraft. The battle was a pivotal early confrontation in the Pacific War, as the United States and its allies sought to halt Japanese expansion into the South Pacific and prevent the isolation of Australia.","Following rapid Japanese advances throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific in late 1941 and early 1942, Japanese high command planned an offensive to seize Port Moresby in New Guinea, which would pose a direct threat to northeastern Australia and secure Japan\u2019s southern defensive perimeter. Under the command of Admirals Isoroku Yamamoto and Shigeyoshi Inoue, a formidable Japanese naval force\u2014including the fleet carriers Sh\u014dkaku and Zuikaku, and the light carrier Sh\u014dh\u014d\u2014set sail to support amphibious landings at Port Moresby and the invasion of Tulagi in the Solomon Islands.","American cryptographers, having partially broken Japanese naval codes, intercepted messages revealing the intended offensive. In response, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, dispatched Task Force 17, commanded by Rear Admiral Frank J. Fletcher. The American force included the fleet carriers USS Yorktown (CV-5) and USS Lexington (CV-2), escorted by the heavy cruisers Minneapolis, Astoria, New Orleans, Chester, Portland, and Australian cruisers HMAS Australia and HMAS Hobart, along with 13 destroyers.","On May 3, 1942, Japanese forces successfully occupied Tulagi, but were soon harassed by airstrikes from Yorktown\u2019s aircraft the following day. The main carrier battle commenced on May 7, when American SBD Dauntless dive bombers and TBD Devastator torpedo bombers located and sank the Japanese light carrier Sh\u014dh\u014d, famously prompting the radio signal, Scratch one flat top, from a U.S. pilot.","Meanwhile, Japanese strike aircraft launched from Sh\u014dkaku and Zuikaku located and sank the U.S. destroyer USS Sims (DD-409) and severely damaged the fleet oiler USS Neosho (AO-23). Crucially, neither main carrier force had yet located the other.","The decisive action took place on May 8, when both fleets managed to locate each other via aerial reconnaissance. American aircraft inflicted severe damage on Sh\u014dkaku, scoring three direct hits with 1,000-pound bombs that disabled her flight deck and forced her withdrawal. However, the Japanese air groups mounted a counterstrike against the U.S. carriers. While Yorktown evaded torpedoes and sustained moderate damage from a bomb hit, Lexington was struck by two Type 91 torpedoes and multiple bombs. Secondary explosions from ignited aviation fuel vapors led to catastrophic fires aboard Lexington, ultimately rendering her unsalvageable. Her crew was evacuated, and she was scuttled by torpedoes from the destroyer USS Phelps (DD-360).","Following the battle, Task Force 17 retired southward to New Caledonia, while Japanese forces withdrew to Truk Atoll. Though the Japanese secured a tactical victory by sinking Lexington and damaging Yorktown, they failed in their primary strategic objective: the capture of Port Moresby. The offensive was abandoned, marking the first significant check to Japanese expansion in the Pacific.","Strategically, the battle was a crucial Allied victory, as it preserved the security of Australia and shifted the momentum toward the United States and its allies. Additionally, the damage sustained by Sh\u014dkaku and the attrition of Zuikaku\u2019s air wing prevented both carriers from participating in the subsequent Battle of Midway\u2014a factor that would prove decisive in the broader course of the Pacific War."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/history/coral_sea/aircraft_zuikaku.png","caption":"Aircraft readying on Zuikaku"},{"url":"/history/coral_sea/neosho.png","caption":"USS Neosho on fire and sinking"},{"url":"/history/coral_sea/shoho_sinking.png","caption":"Shoho on fire and sinking"},{"url":"/history/coral_sea/vals.png","caption":"Japanese Val Dive Bombers head towards the US carriers"},{"url":"/history/coral_sea/yorktown.png","caption":"Yorktown before the battle"},{"url":"/history/coral_sea/lexington.png","caption":"Lexington abandoned and sinking"},{"url":"/history/coral_sea/zeros_depart_shokaku.png","caption":"Zeros depart from Shokaku to strike the US carriers"},{"url":"/history/coral_sea/yorktown_repair.png","caption":"Yorktown undergoing repairs for Midway"}]},{"id":8,"title":"Battle of Midway","date":"June 4th - 7th, 1942","image":"/history/thumbnails/midway.png","content":["The Battle of Midway, fought between June 4\u20137, 1942, stands as one of the most decisive naval battles in history and a pivotal turning point in the Pacific Theater of the Second World War. Occurring approximately 1,500 miles northwest of Hawaii, near Midway Atoll, the battle decisively shifted the strategic initiative to the United States and marked the irreversible decline of Japanese naval supremacy.","In the aftermath of the Doolittle Raid in April 1942, which demonstrated the vulnerability of the Japanese home islands to American carrier-based airpower, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, sought to lure the remaining American aircraft carriers into a decisive engagement. Initially considering a renewed attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese planners instead selected Midway Atoll as the target, deeming it a more practical objective with reduced risk from American land-based air forces. Midway served as a strategic outpost, hosting a small airfield and submarine refueling station vital to U.S. Pacific operations.","To achieve surprise and misdirect U.S. attention, Yamamoto orchestrated a complex plan involving a diversionary attack on the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. Crucially, however, American cryptanalysts\u2014led by Commander Joseph Rochefort and operating out of Station HYPO in Pearl Harbor\u2014had partially decrypted the Japanese JN-25b naval code. By confirming that AF, the coded objective, referred to Midway via a clever intelligence ruse involving a fake water shortage message, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, was able to position his forces to ambush the Japanese fleet.","The Japanese strike force, under Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, deployed four fleet carriers\u2014Akagi, Kaga, S\u014dry\u016b, and Hiry\u016b\u2014accompanied by two battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, totaling 248 carrier-based aircraft. In response, Nimitz mobilized Task Forces 16 and 17, comprising the fleet carriers USS Enterprise (CV-6), USS Hornet (CV-8), and the hastily repaired USS Yorktown (CV-5), supported by seven heavy cruisers, 15 destroyers, and approximately 360 aircraft.","At 4:30 AM on June 4, Nagumo launched an initial strike of 36 Aichi D3A Val dive bombers and 36 Nakajima B5N Kate torpedo bombers against Midway. Although defenders, including six F4F Wildcats, scrambled to intercept, the Japanese inflicted heavy damage on Midway\u2019s installations. Subsequent airstrikes launched from Midway\u2019s airfield caused only minimal damage to the Japanese carriers.","As Japanese aircraft returned for rearming, U.S. carriers launched a series of piecemeal attacks. Many early torpedo bomber squadrons\u2014flying obsolete TBD Devastators\u2014suffered catastrophic losses against disciplined Japanese Zero fighter cover. Despite these losses, their efforts dispersed Japanese defensive formations, setting the stage for a decisive assault.","At approximately 10:22 AM, dive bombers from USS Enterprise\u2019s VB-6 and VS-6 squadrons, along with Yorktown\u2019s VB-3, capitalized on the opportunity. In a matter of minutes, direct bomb hits engulfed Akagi, Kaga, and S\u014dry\u016b, disabling or destroying them. Admiral Nagumo transferred his flag to the light cruiser Nagara as the situation unraveled.","The sole surviving carrier, Hiry\u016b, launched two counterstrikes against USS Yorktown, severely damaging the carrier with bomb and torpedo hits. Though Yorktown\u2019s crew restored partial power, she was struck again and ultimately rendered unsalvageable. On June 6, the Japanese submarine I-168 torpedoed Yorktown and the destroyer USS Hammann (DD-412) during salvage operations, sinking both.","Later on June 4, aircraft from Enterprise and Hornet located and fatally damaged Hiry\u016b, leaving the Imperial Japanese Navy without its carrier striking force. Admiral Raymond Spruance, exercising cautious command, withdrew U.S. forces eastward to avoid potential night surface attacks from Yamamoto\u2019s battleship force, which included the formidable Yamato.","On June 5\u20136, additional U.S. air and submarine operations inflicted further losses, notably sinking the heavy cruiser Mikuma and damaging Mogami. By June 7, with his fleet shattered and four fleet carriers lost, Yamamoto ordered a full withdrawal to Japan.","In total, Japan lost four fleet carriers, one heavy cruiser, nearly 250 aircraft, and over 3,000 personnel. The United States lost one fleet carrier (Yorktown), one destroyer, and 150 aircraft, with approximately 300 personnel killed.","Strategically, Midway irreversibly shifted the balance of power in the Pacific.

The campaign targeted the Solomon Islands, a vital region for securing Allied communication and supply routes between the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Japanese control over this region, particularly through their stronghold at Rabaul and planned advances into New Guinea, posed a significant threat to Allied positions and supply lines in the South Pacific.","The immediate objective of the Allied offensive was to capture several small but strategically valuable islands, including Tulagi, Gavutu-Tanambogo, and Guadalcanal. These islands housed Japanese seaplane bases and airfields capable of supporting further Japanese expansion. American forces intended to establish a foothold in the Solomon chain, gradually pushing northward to neutralize Rabaul and secure the region.","On August 7, 1942, a combined air and naval bombardment marked the opening of the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo. Aircraft from USS Wasp (CV-7), including Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers and Grumman F4F Wildcats, attacked Japanese defensive positions, destroying shore installations, anti-aircraft nests, and seaplanes anchored in nearby harbors. Supporting the aerial assault, the light cruiser USS San Juan (CL-54) and destroyers USS Monssen (DD-436) and USS Buchanan (DD-484) provided naval gunfire to soften enemy defenses.","At 8:00 AM, U.S. Marines from the 1st Marine Division landed on Tulagi, establishing a beachhead with minimal initial resistance. By nightfall, American forces had secured approximately two-fifths of the island, though scattered Japanese forces mounted a fierce night counterattack. Despite minor gains, the Japanese could not dislodge the Marines. By the afternoon of August 8, Tulagi was fully under American control.","Simultaneously, U.S. Marines landed on Gavutu and Tanambogo. Fighting on these smaller islands mirrored the battle for Tulagi, with American forces making significant progress during daylight hours only to encounter determined Japanese resistance during the night. A combination of sustained infantry assaults and concentrated naval gunfire ultimately overwhelmed Japanese defenders. By August 9, both Gavutu and Tanambogo were secured. The battles proved costly; American forces suffered 122 killed, while Japanese casualties totaled 863 dead, nearly the entirety of the defending garrison.","With these preliminary objectives secured, Major General Alexander Vandegrift ordered the landing of approximately 11,000 Marines on Guadalcanal. The principal objective was the capture of an under-construction Japanese airfield near the Lunga River, which would prove vital to both sides in controlling the Solomon Islands. American forces quickly seized the airfield, renaming it Henderson Field in honor of Major Lofton R. Henderson, a Marine aviator killed at Midway. The airfield would soon become the linchpin of Allied operations in the Solomon Islands and a focal point of fierce battles over the subsequent six-month Guadalcanal Campaign.","This offensive marked the first major Allied amphibious operation of the Pacific War and initiated a grueling, attritional struggle for control of the South Pacific, fundamentally shifting the strategic balance in favor of the United States."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/history/tulagi/tulagi_landings.png","caption":"Aerial photo of the US Marine advance to Hill 281 on Tulagi"},{"url":"/history/tulagi/rupertus.png","caption":"General Rupertus observes the landings on Tulagi"},{"url":"/history/tulagi/wading_on_tulagi.png","caption":"Marines wade ashore on Tulagi"},{"url":"/history/tulagi/tulagi_captured.png","caption":"US Marine officers after the successful capture of Tulagi"}]},{"id":10,"title":"First Battle of Savo Island","date":"August 8th - 9th, 1942","image":"/history/thumbnails/first_battle_of_savo_island.png","content":["As United States Marines landed on Tulagi and Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942, a combined U.S.-Australian naval force assembled to support the amphibious assault and secure the surrounding waters.

Turner and Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley (Royal Navy), the Allied task force included six heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and fifteen destroyers, positioned around Savo Island between Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida Island.","The fleet was divided into several groups: a Southern Group comprising HMAS Australia, HMAS Canberra, USS Chicago, and destroyers USS Bagley and USS Patterson; a Northern Group with USS Vincennes, USS Quincy, USS Astoria, and destroyers USS Helm and USS Wilson; and an Eastern covering force consisting of USS San Juan, HMAS Hobart, and destroyers USS Monssen and USS Buchanan. These forces provided air cover, naval bombardment, and logistical support to the Marines during the initial landings on August 7 and 8.","Unbeknownst to the Allies, Japanese Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa had assembled a fast and formidable force of five heavy cruisers (Chokai, Aoba, Furutaka, Kako, Kinugasa), two light cruisers (Tenryu, Yubari), and one destroyer (Yunagi) at Rabaul. Mikawa\u2019s squadron sailed down the narrow waters of New Georgia Sound\u2014soon to be known as The Slot\u2014with the intent of launching a night attack against the Allied naval forces protecting the landings.","Shortly after midnight on August 9, 1942, Mikawa\'s force evaded detection by the Allied radar picket ships USS Blue and USS Ralph Talbot and approached Savo Island under the cover of darkness. At 1:31 AM, Japanese ships illuminated the Southern Group with flares and searchlights before unleashing a devastating torpedo and artillery assault. HMAS Canberra was struck multiple times, lost power, and began listing heavily, while USS Chicago sustained torpedo damage and withdrew westward.","Mikawa\'s cruisers then advanced north, engaging the Northern Group at 1:50 AM. USS Astoria was quickly set ablaze by coordinated fire from Chokai, Aoba, Kinugasa, and Kako, and despite returning fire and disabling one of Chokai\u2019s turrets, Astoria was mortally damaged. Soon after, USS Quincy was caught in a crossfire by Aoba, Furutaka, and Tenryu at 2:10 AM, sinking within half an hour. USS Vincennes attempted to maneuver northward but was intercepted by Kako and Furutaka. Hit by torpedoes and over seventy artillery shells, Vincennes sank around 2:50 AM.","Fearing American carrier-based aircraft at dawn, Admiral Mikawa chose to withdraw rather than press his advantage against the nearby, vulnerable American transport ships\u2014 a decision later criticized by Japanese naval historians for missing an opportunity to further cripple the Allied foothold on Guadalcanal.","The engagement, later known as the Battle of Savo Island, was one of the worst defeats in U.S. naval history.

Recognizing an opportunity to retake Guadalcanal and destroy the American naval forces supporting the Marine invasion, the Imperial Japanese Navy organized a large-scale operation. Their objective was twofold: to land reinforcements on Guadalcanal and to engage and eliminate the U.S. carrier task force protecting the island.","A powerful Japanese task force was assembled, spearheaded by fleet carriers Shokaku and Zuikaku, the light carrier Ryujo, and battleships Hiei and Kirishima under Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo. Supporting them was a formidable cruiser force commanded by Vice Admiral Nobutake Kondo, including heavy cruisers Atago, Maya, Takao, Myoko, Haguro, Kumano, Suzuya, Chikuma, and Tone. The Japanese force departed their bases at Rabaul and Truk Lagoon, advancing down New Georgia Sound toward Guadalcanal.","Opposing them, the U.S. Navy deployed carriers USS Enterprise, USS Saratoga, and USS Wasp, with fast battleship USS North Carolina and accompanying escorts under Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher. However, on the eve of battle, USS Wasp detached to Espiritu Santo to refuel, leaving Enterprise and Saratoga to defend Guadalcanal.","On August 24, 1942, the battle commenced when a PBY Catalina patrol aircraft spotted Ryujo and Tone at 9:35 AM near Guadalcanal. In response, Enterprise and Saratoga launched a strike group of SBD Dauntless dive bombers and F4F Wildcat fighters, which inflicted fatal damage on Ryujo with three to five direct hits. The Japanese light carrier later sank, though the American strike failed to locate the main Japanese carrier force.","In retaliation, Nagumo ordered a strike comprising Val dive bombers, Kate torpedo planes, and Zero fighters from Shokaku and Zuikaku. At 4:00 PM, unbeknownst to the American task force, the Japanese air group was only 88 miles away\u2014inside the effective detection range of the primitive U.S. radar systems, which struggled to reliably track targets within 50\u201390 miles.","With limited early warning, Enterprise and Saratoga went to general quarters. At 4:19 PM, American F4F Wildcats intercepted the first wave of Japanese aircraft, downing 29 enemy planes before they reached the U.S. carriers. Nonetheless, a concentrated attack on Enterprise followed. The carrier and her escorts, including USS North Carolina, unleashed a barrage of anti-aircraft fire, initially disrupting the first wave of dive bombers.","Despite effective defensive fire and evasive maneuvers, Enterprise was struck by three armor-piercing bombs. At 4:44 PM, a bomb dropped by Petty Officer Kiyoto Furuta penetrated five decks before detonating near the waterline, killing 35 sailors and causing serious flooding. A second bomb, delivered by Petty Officer Tamotsu Akimoto, struck moments later near the aft elevator, igniting a powder magazine and killing an additional 35 crewmen. A third bomb hit two minutes later, damaging the midships elevator and locking the rudder to starboard, causing the carrier to circle.","Seven Japanese dive bombers then targeted USS North Carolina, though all missed and were subsequently shot down. Remarkably, Enterprise\u2019s damage control teams managed to restore steering and control fires within an hour.","By 5:46 PM, both Enterprise and Saratoga withdrew from the battle area, with Enterprise severely damaged. A second Japanese airstrike arrived shortly thereafter but found no targets, as the American ships had changed course. The U.S. air strike dispatched to locate Nagumo\u2019s carriers failed in its mission and landed at Henderson Field on Guadalcanal instead.","Though USS Enterprise required a month of repairs at Pearl Harbor, the battle ended in a clear strategic and tactical victory for the United States. The Japanese lost light carrier Ryujo, 61 veteran carrier pilots, and failed to land reinforcements on Guadalcanal. The American carrier force suffered no ship losses and only seven pilots killed. Crucially, the defeat compelled Nagumo and Kondo to abandon their advance and return to Rabaul and Truk, leaving Henderson Field and the U.S. Marine garrison intact.","The Battle of the Eastern Solomons decisively halted the Japanese attempt to regain Guadalcanal and marked a turning point in the Pacific campaign. The attrition of Japan\u2019s experienced naval aviators\u2014a resource they could ill afford to lose\u2014proved especially damaging as the war progressed."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/history/eastern_solomons/enterprise_maneuvering.png","caption":"Enterprise maneuvering under air attack from Japanese Val dive bombers"},{"url":"/history/eastern_solomons/task_force.png","caption":"Enterprise, Wasp, and Saratoga operating near Guadalcanal before Eastern Solomons"},{"url":"/history/eastern_solomons/ryujo.png","caption":"Ryujo with escorting destroyers under air attack from Enterprise and Saratoga dive bombers"},{"url":"/history/eastern_solomons/val_enterprise.png","caption":"A Val dive bomber shot down by anti aircraft fire directly over USS Enterprise"},{"url":"/history/eastern_solomons/third_bomb_enterprise.png","caption":"The third bomb dropped on Enterprise explodes near the midships elevator"},{"url":"/history/eastern_solomons/burned_five_inch_gun.png","caption":"The burnt 5 inch anti aircraft gun on Enterprise which was taken out by the second Val bomb hit"},{"url":"/history/eastern_solomons/uss_north_carolina.png","caption":"USS North Carolina which supported Enterprise during the battle"},{"url":"/history/eastern_solomons/val.png","caption":"Aichi D3A Val Dive Bomber"}]},{"id":12,"title":"Battle of Cape Esperance","date":"October 11th - 12th, 1942","image":"/history/thumbnails/cape_esperance.png","content":["In the aftermath of the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, both the United States and Japan regrouped for the next phase of the Guadalcanal campaign. While American carrier forces withdrew for repairs and resupply, the Japanese maintained a significant edge in night operations around Savo Island and Guadalcanal, routinely running supply and reinforcement missions down \u201cThe Slot\u201d\u2014a narrow passage through the central Solomon Islands\u2014via fast warships in operations known as the Tokyo Express.","With plans underway for a major assault on October 20th, the Japanese dispatched a preliminary reinforcement run under Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa, the architect of the earlier victory at Savo Island. Mikawa\u2019s force aimed to deliver 700 soldiers, four howitzers, two field guns, and an anti-aircraft gun to Guadalcanal. The covering force comprised heavy cruisers Aoba, Kinugasa, and Furutaka, destroyers Fubuki, Hatsuyuki, Asagumo, Natsugumo, Yamagumo, Shirayuki, Murakumo, and Akizuki, along with seaplane tenders Chitose and Nisshin.","Unbeknownst to Mikawa, the U.S. Navy had strengthened its nighttime naval presence near Guadalcanal. A task force under Rear Admiral Norman Scott was stationed near Cape Esperance, the northernmost point of Guadalcanal. Scott\u2019s force included heavy cruisers San Francisco, Salt Lake City, and Boise, light cruiser Helena, and destroyers Farenholt, Duncan, Buchanan, McCalla, and Laffey. Importantly, the American ships were equipped with radar, a technology rapidly improving in effectiveness and soon to prove decisive.","U.S. reconnaissance aircraft spotted the approaching Japanese ships, giving Scott ample warning. The American warships formed a battle line north of Cape Esperance, aiming to ambush the Japanese force as it approached Savo Island.","At approximately 11:45 PM on October 11th, U.S. radar detected the Japanese ships. The engagement began when Helena, Salt Lake City, and San Francisco opened fire on Aoba, which sustained at least 40 hits, disabling her gun directors and two main turrets. In confusion, Aoba turned to starboard, exposing Furutaka to concentrated American gunfire. A direct hit ignited Furutaka\u2019s torpedo tubes, causing a severe fire that crippled the cruiser\u2019s propulsion system.","Destroyer Fubuki was also targeted and sunk by sustained American fire. Despite these losses, Kinugasa managed to fire a spread of torpedoes that narrowly missed Boise. However, a shell from Kinugasa\u2019s main battery struck Boise\u2019s ammunition magazine, igniting an internal explosion that killed roughly 100 sailors. The detonation, however, was partially quenched by seawater flooding the compartment, preventing a catastrophic secondary blast.","Realizing that his force could not outmaneuver the Americans and that surprise had been lost, Mikawa ordered a withdrawal to the north. By dawn on October 12th, the damaged Furutaka sank. Later that day, American dive bombers located a group of Japanese destroyers attempting to assist Furutaka and attacked, sinking Natsugumo and Murakumo.","The Battle of Cape Esperance was a badly needed tactical victory for the United States. The Americans lost no capital ships, though Boise was seriously damaged. The Japanese lost heavy cruiser Furutaka, destroyers Fubuki, Natsugumo, and Murakumo, and failed to deliver their reinforcements.","Most importantly, Cape Esperance demonstrated that the U.S. Navy had begun to close the qualitative gap in night fighting that had plagued it since the outbreak of the Pacific War. Effective use of radar-directed gunfire and improved tactical coordination allowed Rear Admiral Scott\u2019s task force to successfully intercept and defeat a Japanese night operation for the first time in the campaign.","While a relatively small engagement compared to the titanic naval battles soon to follow, Cape Esperance buoyed American morale and provided a critical lesson in the tactics and technology needed for future victories in the Solomon Islands campaign."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/history/cape_esperance/aoba.png","caption":"Aoba disembarking dead and wounded sailors after the Battle of Cape Esperance"},{"url":"/history/cape_esperance/uss_boise.png","caption":"USS Boise at Espiritu Santo in August 1942"},{"url":"/history/cape_esperance/soldier_pointing_boise.png","caption":"A sailor points to the scoreboard on USS Boise in November 1942.

It was held in Reykjavik, Iceland during the height of the Cold War. Previously, Spassky had won the Candidates tournament of 1966 and 1969 and faced World Champion Tigran Petrosian losing to him in 1966 by a margin of 12\xbd to 11\xbd and beating him in 1969 by a margin of 12\xbd to 10\xbd. Spassky was known as a player that had a universal style, but could press the initiative when needed. Previous to the 1972 World Chess Championship, most of the World Chess Champions had originated from the Soviet Union. These included players such as Mikhail Tal, Mikhail Botvinik, and Tigran Petrosian.","Bobby Fischer\'s route to the 1972 World Chess Championship started with a demolition of the field at the 1970 Palma de Mallorca Interzonal Tournament. This tournament\'s format was a round-robin style where twenty four of the best grandmasters played each other. The top six players of the Interzonal tournament qualified to the 1971 Candidates match and were Fischer (18\xbd), Bent Larsen of Denmark (15), Efim Geller of the Soviet Union (15), Robert Hubner of West Germany (15), Mark Taimanov of the Soviet Union (14), and Wolfgang Uhlmann of East Germany (14). Petrosian, who was the loser of the 1969 World Chess Championship, and Victor Korchnoi, as the runner up of the previous Candidates tournament were also included in the 1971 Candidates Tournament. In the Candidates, Fischer destroyed Mark Taimanov 6 - 0 in the quarterfinals and destroyed Bent Larsen in the semifinals 6 - 0 (happened in my hometown of Denver). Fischer then faced Petrosian in the Final in Buenos Aires playing a nine game match which Fischer won by a margin of 6\xbd to 2\xbd. An interesting tidbit about the final is that Petrosian ended Bobby Fischer\'s twenty game win streak following game 2. After winning the Candidates, Fischer was given the right to challenge Spassky for the world title.","The Soviets proposed four cities to host the match which included Reykjavik, Amsterdam, Dortmund, and Paris. Fischer declined all the options due to the low prize fund alloted for the players. Fischer instead wanted to play in Buenos Aires, Sarajevo or Belgrade. Fischer declined also in part to his mistrust of the Soviets and wanted Spassky to come to him across the Atlantic. Dr. Max Euwe, who was president of the chess governing body, FIDE, declared that the match will be held for twelve games in Belgrade and then twelve games in Reykjavik. Fischer and Spassky both hated Euwe\'s idea because it meant that the world champion could not dictate the terms and Fischer may not be able to get Spassky out of his comfort zone. Euwe gave an ultimatum to Fischer to either play the proposed match in both Belgrade and Reykjavik or that the Championship match will be played between Spassky and Petrosian in Moscow. Fischer reluctantly agreed but stipulated that he wanted more money. As a result, the organizers in Belgrade backed out and Reykjavik was chosen to host all twenty four games.","One day before the Match of the Century was supposed to take place, Fischer refused to fly from New York to Reykjavik for monetary reasons and thus the match was postponed by an additional two days. Jim Slater, who was a British investor, offered to double the prize fund of the tournament to $250,000. Former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger also pleaded with Fischer to play Spassky in Reykjavik. Eventually, Fischer flew to Reykjavik but the match was still postponed because Spassky demanded that Fischer apologize to FIDE for hijacking the terms of the match. Fischer apologized publicly to Spassky and the match started on July 11th, 1972."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/chess/fisher.png","caption":"Robert James Fischer, World Chess Championship Challenger, USA"},{"url":"/chess/spaasky.png","caption":"Boris Vasiljevic Spassky, World Chess Defending Champion, USSR"},{"url":"/chess/petrosian.png","caption":"Tigran Petrosian, Former World Chess Champion, USSR"},{"url":"/chess/newspaper.png","caption":"Newspaper headline indicating the increase of prize fund money"}]},{"id":2,"title":"Game 1","subtype":"Nimzo-Indian Defense, Normal Variation.

The arbiter of the match, German Grandmaster Lothar Schmid started the clocks and Spassky with the white pieces played d4. After nine minutes disappear on Fischer\'s clock, Fischer arrive on stage and plays Nf6. Following c4 and e6, Spassky avoids the Nimzo-Indian defense initially by playing Nf3 and asking Fischer whether to go for a Queen\'s Indian setup. Fischer ignores this move and plays d5 transposing into the Queen\'s gambit declined. Spassky then plays Nc3 and then Bb4 transposing into the Nimzo-Indian Defense. Spassky plays e3 as a way to avoid going into an aggressive line similar to a game played between Petrosian and Spassky in the previous Championship match. Fischer castles on move five to get his king to safety and Spassky plays Bd3. Fischer strikes in the center with c5 following up with Nc6. Spassky counters with castles (O-O) and then a3 to challenge Fischer\'s dark squared Bishop.","At this point, Fischer can choose either to capture on d4 with his c5 pawn or capture the knight on c3 with the dark squared bishop on b4. However, Fischer backs off and plays Ba5 which Spassky did not expect. After a long think, Spassky plays Ne2 which is a move from a previous game between Spassky and GM Nikolai Krogius. Fischer immediately replies with dxc4 followed by Spassky\'s bishop capturing on c4 (Bxc4). Fischer moves his darked squared Bishop back to b6 to defend the c5 pawn (Bb6). Spassky captures the pawn on c5 (dxc5) with his D pawn and in the game between Krogius and Spassky, Bxc5 was played but instead Fischer, noticing that Spassky\'s queen is exposed, plays Qxd1 for a queen trade. Spassky recaptures with Rxd1 and then Fischer with Bxc5. By move twelve, both queens are off the board as well as the e and d pawns for both sides. Spassky reapplies pressure with b4 which forces Fischer\'s dark squared bishop back to e7 (Be7). Spassky fianchettoes to b2 with his light squared bishop which applies pressure on Fischer\'s Kingside (Bb2). Fischer plays a nice move with his light squared bishop to d7 (Bd7) which allows Fischer to gain a tempo on Spassky\'s rook when his knight on c6 moves eventually.","Spassky moves Rac1 which is met with Rfd8. Ned4 is played by Spassky and Fischer exchanges knights with Nxd4 and Nxd4 by Spassky. Fischer now gains a tempo on the rook with Ba4. Spassky stops this with Bb3. Fischer at this point had an option to capture the knight on d4 but this would lead into an endgame where Spassky would end up with the bishop pair compared to Fischer with a bishop and a knight. Instead Fischer captures Spassky\'s light squared bishop with Bxb3 to which Spassky replies with Nxb3. With an opening on the D file created by Spassky\'s Nxb3, Fischer plays Rxd1+ (captures with check) followed by Rxd1 by Spassky (exchanging rooks). Fischer then grabs ahold of the C file with Rc8. At this point in the game, the material is equal on the board, but Fischer\'s remaining rook is in fact more impressive than Spassky\'s remaining rook because of Fischer\'s dark squared bishop controlling both d6 and d8 while his knight controlls d7. Fischer can create a rook lift to c7 at any time. Spassky improves the position of his King with Kf1 and Fischer replies with Kf8. Spassky moves Ke2 and Fischer reactivates his knight with Ne4. Spassky challenges Fischer\'s rook wih Rc1 which leads to a trade of rooks. Fischer plays Rxc1 followed by Spassky\'s Bxc1.","Fischer now pushes f6 presumably to grab more space on the Kingside and Spassky attacks Fischer\'s Queenside with Na5. Nd6 is played by Fischer to protect the b7 pawn. Spassky improves the King\'s position once again with Kd3 and Fischer forces the knight on a5 to move away with Bd8. Nc4 is played by Spassky to exchange knights and Fischer protects with Bc7. The knights are exchanged with Nxd6, Bxd6 and now Spassky advances to b6 moving his pawns on the Queenside to light squares which can\'t be touched by Fischer\'s dark squared bishop.","At this point in the game, the material remains completely even and it seems that the game will proceed into a drawn endgame, but Fischer plays one of the biggest blunders in his entire chess career and possibly in the history of the World Chess Championship. Fischer plays Bxh2 which blunders and traps the dark squared bishop. At this moment, everybody in the playing hall audience gasped when this move was played. Spassky correctly traps the bishop with g3. Fischer, seemingly oblivious to his blunder continues with h5 and Spassky completely locks down Fischers bishop by moving Ke2. Fischer pushes h4 followed by Spassky\'s Kf3. Fischer finally realized that his bishop was trapped and that he might have miscalculated. Fischer moves Ke7 to improve his king and Spassky closes on Fischer\'s trapped bishop with Kg2. Fischer captures on g3 with hxg3 followed with Spassky\'s fxg3. Fischer recaptures with Bxg3 and then Kxg3 followed by Fischer\'s Kd6 making Fischer\'s king active on the Queenside.","Spassky locks down his Queenside pawns with a4 and Fischer moves Kd5. At this point, the question of the match really is if Fischer\'s two extra pawns on the Kingside are compensation for Spassky\'s extra piece. Spassky moves Ba3 which controlls all dark sqaures on the Queenside. Fischer moves Ke4 to attack white\'s e3 pawn and Spassky defends with Bc5. Fischer pushes a6 to break open Spassky\'s connected pawns on the Queenside. Spassky closes the position with b6 and Fischer pushes f5. Spassky moves Kh4 to get his king closer to Fischer\'s pawns and Fischer advances f4 challenging white\'s e3 pawn. At this point, the game was adjourned since the fourty move time control had been reached. Spassky sealed exf4 and Fischer the next day played Kxf4 followed by Spassky\'s Kh5. Kh5 is a winning idea by white because Spassky\'s king will now start marching towards Fischer\'s Queenside to gobble up all of the pawns. Spassky\'s bishop will protect the b6 pawn which is the winning pawn. Fischer has to prevent Spassky\'s king walk by playing Kf5 which is met with Be3 and then Ke4 attacking the bishop. Spassky gets his bishop out of the way with Bf2 and then Kf5 by Fischer. Spassky now prevents Fischer\'s king from having any effect on the rest of the game with Bh4 which also puts black\'s king in zugzwang. Fischer has to move a pawn and he moves e5 followed by Be5. Black plays e4 and Spassky replies with Be3 preventing any further pushing by Fischer\'s passed C pawn. Fischer now must move the king to f6 (Kf6) followed by white\'s Kg4. Spassky has freed his King from the H file.","Fischer moves Ke5 and Spassky counters with Kg5. Out of moves, Fischer tries Kd5 to reposition to the Queenside followed by Spassky moving Kf5. Fischer pushes a5 to reopen the Queenside position. Bf2 is played by Spassky and Fischer develops his G pawn to g5 to give it up. Spassky gladly accepts with Kxg5 and Fischer goes for the Queenside pawns with Kc4. Spassky repositions back to f5 (Kf5) and Fischer moves Kb4. Kxe4 followed by Kxa4 are played. Spassky moves Kd5 and Fischer moves Kb5. However, after Spassky played Kd6, Bobby Fischer resigned the game on move 56.","The score following Game 1 in the 1972 World Chess Championship is now 1 - 0 in favor of Spassky."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/chess/clockstarts.png","caption":"GM Lothar Schmid starts the clock with Fischer absent"},{"url":"/chess/fisher_arrives.png","caption":"Fischer arrives late and he and Spassky shake hands"},{"url":"/chess/fisher_captures.png","caption":"Fischer captures a piece"},{"url":"/chess/blunder.png","caption":"Fischer blunders his bishop which loses the game"}]},{"id":3,"title":"Game 3","subtype":"Modern Benoni, Classical Main Line (A77)","date":"1972","image":"/chess/chess.png","content":["Move Order: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 c5 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 6.Nc3 g6 7.Nd2 Nbd7 8.e4 Bg7 9.Be2 0-0 10.0-0 Re8 11.Qc2 Nh5 12.Bxh5 gxh5 13.Nc4 Ne5 14.Ne3 Qh4 15.Bd2 Ng4 16.Nxg4 hxg4 17.Bf4 Qf6 18.g3 Bd7 19.a4 b6 20.Rfe1 a6 21.Re2 b5 22.Rae1 Qg6 23.b3 Re7 24.Qd3 Rb8 25.axb5 axb5 26.b4 c4 27.Qd2 Rbe8 28.Re3 h5 29.R3e2 Kh7 30.Re3 Kg8 31.R3e2 Bxc3 32.Qxc3 Rxe4 33.Rxe4 Rxe4 34.Rxe4 Qxe4 35.Bh6 Qg6 36.Bc1 Qb1 37.Kf1 Bf5 38.Ke2 Qe4+ 39.Qe3 Qc2+ 40.Qd2 Qb3 41.Qd4 Bd3+ 0 - 1","Following the loss of Game 1, Fischer gave an ultimatum to chief arbiter Lothar Schmid requiring that all television cameras broadcasting the match be removed prior to Game 2. If this ultimatum was not met, Fischer would forfeit the match and leave Reykjavik. Media tycoon Chester Fox had bought all the rights for the match and loss of broadcasting would result in huge financial losses for his company, Chester Fox inc. Fischer however stuck to his ultimatum and by the time game 2 was supposed to start, Fischer was absent. Spassky arrived at the playing hall on time and with the black pieces, started Fischer\'s clock. By the time thirty five minutes elapsed on Fischer\'s clock, Fox agreed to remove all cameras from the playing hall so Fischer would show and make his first move as white. Fischer agreed, but stipulated to Lothar Schmid that his elapsed thirty five minutes be given back to him. This request unfortunately could not be fulfilled since there was no regulation in the FIDE match guidelines that allowed for time to be given back. After one hour elapsed, Schmid was forced to stop the clock and Fischer forfeited game 2 giving Spassky a 2 - 0 scoreline over Fischer.","Everybody around the world feared that Fischer was out of the match and it was rumored that Fischer would leave back to the United States and forfeit the match entirely. Before Game 3 was scheduled to start, Fischer\'s team including his lawyer, Paul Marshall, and his second, William Lombardy, called Schmid to ask if the third game could be played in the back room of the playing hall. Schmid took Fischer\'s demands to Spassky and surprisingly, against the wishes of the Russian Chess Federation, Spassky agreed to Fischer\'s terms. On the night of July 16th, 1972, Spassky arrives in the back room, the clock is started and Spassky plays d4.","Fifteen minutes later, Fischer arrived at the back room and complained to Schmid again that the cameras were still too noisy and as a result, all cameras were shut off except for one CCTV camera which was silent. Fischer replied to Spassky with Nf6. Spassky goes into the Queen\'s Gambit with c4 and Fischer declines the gambit with e6. Spassky responds Nf3 and Fischer plays c5 challenging Spassky to a Benoni game. Spassky accepts the Benoni and plays d5 going into the Modern Benoni main line which is one of Fischer\'s d4 opening specialities. Fischer defeated German GM Wolfgang Uhlmann in the 1970 Interzonal tournament in a similar Modern Benoni setup. Fischer captures with exd5 and Spassky recaptures playing cxd5 followed by Fischer\'s d6 idea. Spassky defends his new D pawn with Nc3 and Fischer prepares to Fianchetto his dark squared bishop with Bg7 by first preparing g6. At this point in the game, the position is pretty even and commonly white proceeds with moves such as e4 or h3 but instead Spassky prepared Nd2. Fischer replies with Nbd7 continuing development and Spassky pushes e4. Fischer fianchettoes with Bg7 followed by Spassky\'s development of the light squared bishop with Be2 and both sides castle (O-O). Fischer moves Re8 to add an attaacker to Spassky\'s E pawn. The game at this point still resembles a common position of the Modern Benoni, but Spassky surprises Fischer with his preparation and on move 11, plays Qc2.","The move Qc2 is pivotol in the game as it shifts the queen away from the Kingside of the board. With the queen on its starting square (d1), the battery created with the light squared bishop on e2 prevents black from developing his light square bishop fully. Seeing this move, Fischer takes advantage with Nh5. On the surface level, Fischer is offering a knight to Spassky and a consequent ruining of the pawn structure with the recapture by Fischer\'s pawn on g6. However, this move actually forces Spassky to capture the knight because all other moves from white will allow back to move into a better position. Spassky plays Bxh5 followed by the recapture by Fischer with gxh5. Spassky moves with pressure on Fischer\'s D pawn with Nc4. Fischer kicks Spassky\'s knight on c4 away with his own knight (Ne5). Spassky repositions the knight on c4 with Ne3 keeping an eye on the f5 square which Fischer will eventually push to open up the closed Benoni structure. On move fourteen, Fischer plays Qh4 which creates all sorts of threats on the Kingside of the board for Spassky. The best move for white at move fifteen is Bd2 since Fischer\'s idea of Nf3+ doesn\'t hold water. The line from here would continue with something like gxf3 followed by Be5 which threatens checkmate on h2 with Qxh2. Spassky can easily defend by moving the rook to the E file and moving the knight to f1 which will blunt black\'s initiative. Spassky finds Bd2 which continues development with the dark square bishop while also connecting rooks. Fischer responds with Ng4 to improve the position of the knight on the Kingside and his pawn structure. Spassky must prevent checkmate by the queen on h2 and plays Nxg4 with Fischer recapturing with hxg4. Fischer\'s pawn structure on this move is now fixed. Spassky plays Bf4 with ideas of repostioning the bishop to g3 to keep an eye on one of the central e5 square.","Fischer finds a great idea with Qf6 to remanouver his queen and attack Spassky\'s dark squared bishop on f4. If the bishop is moved immediately, say down its current diagonal or to g3, Fischer can play h5 followed by h4 which will crush white\'s Kingside position. Spassky plays a prophylactic move with g3 to prevent h5 and subsequently h4 by Fischer. Fischer continues development with Bd7 which is met with Spassky\'s a4. Fischer has to prevent further Queenside expansion by Spassky with b6. Spassky moves his castled rook to the E file with Rfe1 and Fischer pushes a6. Spassky calculates that there is no counterplay possible on the Queenside for white and instead moves Re2 preparing to double rooks on the E file while preparing to push e5 with his current e4 pawn. Fischer plays b5 and Spassky immediately moves Rae1. Fischer spots that e5 will be coming to Qg6 effectively will open an attack on Spassky\'s queen if e5 is pushed. Spassky moves b3 to halt Fischer\'s expansion and Fischer plays a waiting move with Re7, potentially preparing to double up on the E file as well. Spassky plays Qd3 to support white\'s capture of the black b5 pawn and Fischer defends with Rb8. White now trades on the Queenside with axb5 followed by black\'s axb5.","In this middlegame, Spassky does not have a good move because e5 can\'t be pushed since the Queen will be lost and Spassky can\'t play anything else because Fischer will push b4 on the next move. Spassky elects to play b4 himself and Fischer counters with c4 which attacks the white queen on d3 and creates a passed C pawn for black. Spassky must move his queen and plays Qd2 and Fischer continues his doubling on the E file with Rbe8. Spassky plays the waiting move Re3 since there is no good option for white and Fischer capitalizes with h5 attempting to break open the white Kingside. Spassky must wait with R3e2 and Fischer tests Spassky\'s patience with Kh7. Spassky has to repeat with Re3 and Fischer replies Kg7. Spassky again plays R3e2 threatening a three fold repetition draw and now Fischer grabs a pawn with Bxc3. Spassky recaptures with Qxc3 and then Rxe4. Rooks are exchanged with Spassky playing Rxe4 followed by Fischer\'s Rxe4 again. Spassky captures with Rxe4 but this allows Fischer an opening with Qxe4 to improve the position of the black Queen. Spassky moves Bh6 threatening checkmate on g7 with the white queen on c3. Fischer prevents checkmate with Qg6 and on move 35, Spassky plays Bc1 which gets the bishop out of harms way. Fischer pins the bishop with Qb1 and Spassky moves Kf1 attempting to unpin and move the white king out of the corner of the board. Fischer moves Bf5 with ideas of Bd3 or Be4 followed by Bf3. Spassky unpins with Ke2 and black plays Qe4+. With Qe4+, Fischer forces Spassky\'s Queen out of the long a1 to h8 diagonal and Spassky offers a trade of Queens with Qe3. Fischer moves Qc2+ and Spassky blocks with Qd2. Fischer plays Qb3 preparing for a push of black\'s C pawn.","Time control was reached with Fischer\'s Qb3 on move 40 and now Fischer must seal his 41st move. Spassky plays Qd4 on move 41 which blunders the game and Fischer seals Bd3+. The next day, the game was meant to be continued but before Fischer could arrive to play his 41st move (Bd3+), Boris Spassky resigned the game on move 41 since any move will allow the C pawn to be pushed and thus ends the game for Spassky. Game 3 of the 1972 World Chess Championship was actually the first time Fischer defeated Spassky in classical time control. Game 3 is often cited as the turning point in the match as Fischer now has momentum going into Game 4.","The score following Game 3 in the 1972 World Chess Championship is now 2 - 1 in favor of Spassky"],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/chess/clockstarts.png","caption":"GM Lothar Schmid starts the clock with Fischer absent"},{"url":"/chess/fisher_arrives.png","caption":"Fischer arrives late and he and Spassky shake hands"},{"url":"/chess/fisher_captures.png","caption":"Fischer captures a piece"},{"url":"/chess/blunder.png","caption":"Fischer blunders his bishop which loses the game"}]},{"id":4,"title":"Game 4","subtype":"Sicilian Defense: Fischer-Sozin Attack, Leonhardt Variation (B88)","date":"1972","image":"/chess/chess.png","content":["Move Order: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 Nc6 6.Bc4 e6 7.Bb3 Be7 8.Be3 0-0 9.0-0 a6 10.f4 Nxd4 11.Bxd4 b5 12.a3 Bb7 13.Qd3 a5 14.e5 dxe5 15.fxe5 Nd7 16.Nxb5 Nc5 17.Bxc5 Bxc5+ 18.Kh1 Qg5 19.Qe2 Rad8 20.Rad1 Rxd1 21.Rxd1 h5 22.Nd6 Ba8 23.Bc4 h4 24.h3 Be3 25.Qg4 Qxe5 26.Qxh4 g5 27.Qg4 Bc5 28.Nb5 Kg7 29.Nd4 (diagram) Rh8 30.Nf3 Bxf3 31.Qxf3 Bd6 32.Qc3 Qxc3 33.bxc3 Be5 34.Rd7 Kf6 35.Kg1 Bxc3 36.Be2 Be5 37.Kf1 Rc8 38.Bh5 Rc7 39.Rxc7 Bxc7 40.a4 Ke7 41.Ke2 f5 42.Kd3 Be5 43.c4 Kd6 44.Bf7 Bg3 45.c5+ \xbd - \xbd","Game 4 was played out on the main playing hall in Reykjavik when Spassky complained that the back room where Game 3 was played had ample distraction from the road outside the building. Fischer also complained that if Game 4 was to be played on the main stage, that all cameras had to be removed prior. Chief arbiter Lothar Schmid was once again in a tricky position but managed to refute Fischer\'s complaint as the formal complaint itself had not been signed by Fischer but rather his lawyer Paul Marshall. As a result, Fischer had to play on the main stage with the exception of the singular CCTV camera recording the game instead of multiple cameras. Both players arrived on time and in Game 4, Fischer is white and Spassky is black.","As is typical when Fischer has the white pieces, he opened with 1. e4 which is the strong King\'s pawn opening. In all classical games previous, Spassky had always replied with e5 to Fischer but instead Spassky prepared c5 transposing into the Sicilian defense. By playing the Sicilian, Spassky directly challenges Fischer to a Sozin attack variation. Fischer continues Nf3 and Spassky replies d6 which follows the standard open Sicilian line. Fischer strikes in the center with d4 by which Spassky captures (cxd4). The game transposes fully into the open Sicilian with Fischer\'s Nxd4 and Spassky\'s Nf6. Fischer plays Nc3 cementing the open Sicilian game. From this position, black has options of transposing into a Scheveningan (e6) or a Najdorf (a6) variation but instead Spassky plays Nc6 (Classical line of the open Sicilian) with an attack on Fischer\'s d4 knight. Fischer confidently plays Bc4 and the Sozin attack is on the board. Spassky plays the strongest reply which is e6 transposing into the Scheveningan-Sozin-Leonhardt variation and Fischer moves back playing Bb3. At this point, Fischer\'s light squared bishop is eyeing Spassky\'s kingside and both players control the center quite well. Spassky prepares to castle with Be7 on move 7. At this point in the game, the position is exactly the same as Fischer vs. Efim Geller from the 1962 Candidates tournament in Curacao. Fischer in that game played f4 immediately and lost to Geller. Interestingly, Efim Geller was one of Spassky\'s seconds for the 1972 World Chess Championship and as a result, Spassky knows this game probably by heart. Fischer instead played a slight improvement on this idea (Be3) which adds a defender to the knight on d4 and prepares f4.","Spassky, not bothered by Fischer\'s slow move, castles kingside (0-0) and Fischer castles as well. Now both white and black\'s kings are safely protected and the game can continue. In the 1970 Palma de Mallorca Interzonal tournament, one of Fischer\'s only losses (against Bent Larsen) at that tournament was when Fischer played Qe2 on move 9 instead of 0-0. This castles move on move 9 further shows Fischer\'s preparation for Spassky. Spassky improves his queenside with a6 and Fischer plays f4 striking in the center. Spassky replies with an active move of Nxd4 which is met with Bxd4 (one set of knights is traded). Spassky plays b5 which further activates his queenside and preparing to develop his light square bishop from c8. Fischer stops any further queenside expansion with a3 and Spassky develops his light squared bishop with Bb7. Fischer played Qd3 on move 13 which connects his rooks and develops his queen to the defense of the queenside. The first critical moment of the game is reached where Spassky has to decide whether to play passively as black or actively and Spassky, with the help of Geller\'s preparation, played a5 which further pushes on white\'s queenside. White now has problems pushing either f4 or capturing on b5 since they would lead to disadvantageous positions for white. Fischer plays e5 which frees his knight on c3 to move but does come at the price of activating Spassky\'s fianchettoed light square bishop. The pawns are exchanged with Spassky\'s dxe5 and Fischer\'s fxe5 and Spassky moves his f6 knight to safety playing Nd7. Noticing a weakness in the queenside pawns, Fischer captures on b5 playing Nxb5 and Spassky responds with Nc5 forking Fischer\'s queen on d3 and light squared bishop on b3. Nc5 guarantees Spassky will win the white bishop pair and gives Spassky an advantage in the endgame. Fischer realizes this and plays Bxc5, giving up his dark squared bishop to Spassky\'s Bxc5+. Spassky\'s bishop now checks the white king and Fischer moves it to the edge of the board with Kh1. At this point, Spassky goes into a fifteen minute think to contemplate the position.","Trading queen\'s at this stage of the game would trade down into a bishop and rook endgame to favor black slightly thanks to the optimum position of Spassky\'s dark squared bishop. Spassky knows that the advantage would be slight and instead elects to play Qg5 threatening a checkmate on g2 (Spassky\'s light squared bishop on b7 nicely protects the queen if it captures on g2 with checkmate). Fischer prevents checkmate with Qe2 and Spassky develops his kingside rook with Rad8. Fischer offers to trade down all of the rooks with Rad1. A pair of rooks is exchanged with Rxd1 and Rxd1 and Spassky plays h5 to bust open the white kingside pawns. Spassky is at a clear advantage in this position with the black queen eyeing the g2 pawn and black\'s bishop pair staring at the castled white king. Fischer immediately places his knight on d6 (Nd6) to challenge the black light squared bishop and Spassky moves his bishop back to a8 (Ba8). Fischer now gains initiative and starts improving the position with Bc4 threatening to push the white B pawn. Spassky ignores this threat and continues with h4 moving his H pawn closer to the white king. Fischer blocks any h3 ideas by pushing h3 himself. Spassky now moves the dark squared bishop to e3 (Be3) with the threat of Bf4 followed by Qg3 and Qh2 checkmate. Fischer responds by offering a Queen trade with Qg4. Spassky declines playing Qxe5 which equilizes captured material for both black and white. This equilizer does not last for long with Fischer capturing the black H pawn (Qxh4). Spassky, on move 26, plays a brilliancy with g5 which gains a tempo on the white queen and blocks the white queen from influencing the d8 square. Fischer plays Qg4 which will initiate a fork on the queen and the rook (the line might look something like: 27. Qg4 Rd8 28. Nxf7 Rxd1 29. Qxd1 Kxf7 30. Qd7+). Spassky responds instead with Bc5 challenging Fischer\'s strong knight on d6 and Fischer evades with Nb5. Spassky improves the position of the king with Kg7 allowing the rook on f8 to join the attack (by moving to h8) but Fischer refutes playing Nd4 (with the idea of shifting the knight to f3 to keep an eye on the h4 square where black\'s rook might be heading).","At this critical moment in the game, Spassky indeed moves Rh8 instead of Rd8 which would have been winning for black. Fischer as planned plays Nf3 which deters the black rook from jumping to h4 so Spassky plays Bxf3 eliminating the knight. This however, allows Fischer to get rid of Spassky\'s bishop pair with Qxf3. Spassky threatens checkmate once again with Bd6 (the dark squared bishop supports the black Queen checkmating on h2) but Fischer now plays Qc3 which forces a queen trade. As an aside, Spassky could have prevented this with the previously mentioned Rd8 idea on move 29 which allows for a triple attack against the white knight on d4 which forces Fischer to play c3 to protect it. This continuation on would not have worked for Fischer in this scenario because the c3 square is used up by the white pawn on c3.","At the Qc3 move on move 32, Spassky is forced to play Qxc3 followed by Fischer recapturing playing bxc3. The position is now mostly drawn with opposite colored bishops and a pair of rooks on the board. Spassky tries Be5 but this is met with Rd7 with a threat of Bxe6 since black\'s f7 pawn is pinned. Spassky unpins with Kf6 and Fischer improves his king with Kg1. Spassky captures a doubled C pawn with Bxc3 and now Fischer plays Be2 with Spassky countering with Be5. Fischer continues to march his king with Kf1 and Spassky plays Rc8 threatening to pick up the c2 pawn. This move allows Fischer to play Bh5 with the threat of picking up the f7 pawn. Spassky trades the rooks to prevent a captures on f7 with Rc7. Fischer agrees and plays Rxc7 and Spassky completes the trade with Bxc7. Now the engame is pawns with opposite colored bishops which is now completely drawn. A few more moves are played with Fischer playing a4 and Spassky responding with Ke7. Ke2 played by Fischer and f5 by Spassky. Kd3 played by Fischer and Spassky plays Be5 (both players at this points are trying to exploit any initiative in the position). Fischer pushes c4 and Spassky responds Kd6. Finally, Fischer plays Bf7 and Spassky plays Bg3 trying to once again find any weakness. Fischer added one more check on move 45 with c5+ and at this point, both players agreed to a draw.","Spassky in this game demonstrated his capability to challenge Fischer in his extremely strong Sozin variation and what a great second Efim Geller is to Spassky. However, Spassky did have chances in the game and could ahve pushed for a win, but could not find the right moves. With a draw, Fischer had to rethink his opening preparation against the Sicilian defense from Spassky for future games.","The score following Game 4 in the 1972 World Chess Championship is now 2.5 - 1.5 in favor of Spassky"],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/chess/fisher.png","caption":"Robert James Fischer, World Chess Championship Challenger, USA"},{"url":"/chess/spaasky.png","caption":"Boris Vasiljevic Spassky, World Chess Defending Champion, USSR"},{"url":"/chess/petrosian.png","caption":"Tigran Petrosian, Former World Chess Champion, USSR"},{"url":"/chess/newspaper.png","caption":"Newspaper headline indicating the increase of prize fund money"}]},{"id":5,"title":"Game 5","subtype":" Nimzo-Indian Defense: Huebner Variation, Main Line (E41)","date":"1972","image":"/chess/chess.png","content":["Move Order: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Nf3 c5 5.e3 Nc6 6.Bd3 Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 d6 8.e4 e5 9.d5 Ne7 10.Nh4 h6 11.f4 Ng6 12.Nxg6 fxg6 13.fxe5 dxe5 14.Be3 b6 15.0-0 0-0 16.a4 a5 17.Rb1 Bd7 18.Rb2 Rb8 19.Rbf2 Qe7 20.Bc2 g5 21.Bd2 Qe8 22.Be1 Qg6 23.Qd3 Nh5 24.Rxf8+ Rxf8 25.Rxf8+ Kxf8 26.Bd1 Nf4 27.Qc2 Bxa4 0 - 1","The origins of the Pacific War can be traced to the aftermath of World War I and the Treaty of Versailles negotiations in 1919. During the First World War, Japan and the United States fought as members of the Allied Powers alongside Britain, France, and Russia (which withdrew in 1917), opposing the Central Powers comprising Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire. In the postwar settlements, Germany was compelled to pay reparations to the Allied nations, with the notable exceptions of Russia and Japan. Japan\'s marginalization during the Versailles conference, particularly regarding its proposed racial equality clause and territorial claims in East Asia and the Pacific, engendered a sense of resentment and betrayal among Japanese leadership.","Throughout the 1920s, Japan embarked on an aggressive program of military expansion and modernization, enhancing its army with new conscripts, commissioning faster, more heavily armed naval vessels, and developing an increasingly sophisticated air force. By the 1930s, as fascist ideologies gained ground in Europe, most notably with Adolf Hitler\'s rise to power in Germany, the balance of power within Japan shifted decisively from the civilian government and the Emperor toward a militarist oligarchy. The armed forces, dominated by generals and admirals, exercised de facto control over state policy, reducing Emperor Hirohito to a largely symbolic role in governance. Among the military figures who rose to prominence during this period was Hideki Tojo.","Born in 1884 in Tokyo\'s Kojimachi district, Tojo began his military career in 1905, participating in the final stages of the Russo-Japanese War. He steadily ascended the ranks, achieving the position of major general by 1934. Although he opposed the attempted coup d\u2019\xe9tat against the Emperor in 1936, Tojo remained a central figure in Japan\'s militarist regime.","Japan\'s imperial ambitions became manifest in its invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Under the leadership of generals such as Shigeru Honjo, Jir\u014d Tamon, and Senj\u016br\u014d Hayashi, Japanese forces rapidly occupied key territories. The 7th Division, consisting of approximately 61,000 troops, confronted an estimated 160,000 Chinese soldiers. The Jinzhou operation, conducted by Tamon, resulted in the capture of Jinzhou and, subsequently, Nanjing. This campaign significantly weakened the Chinese Nationalist government, led by Chiang Kai-shek, and facilitated Japan\u2019s control over much of southern Manchuria. In early 1932, Tamon directed a northern offensive that seized the city of Harbin, completing Japan\u2019s occupation of the region.","In the aftermath, Ma Zhanshan, a prominent Chinese military leader in the north, was coerced into cooperating with the Japanese-established puppet regime in Manchuria. The invasion marked Japan\u2019s first major territorial expansion on the Asian mainland and served as a precursor to further aggression in East Asia and the Pacific. The swift and overwhelming nature of the campaign, reminiscent of later blitzkrieg tactics, caught Chinese forces unprepared and contributed to the eruption of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/chess/fisher.png","caption":"Robert James Fischer, World Chess Championship Challenger, USA"},{"url":"/chess/spaasky.png","caption":"Boris Vasiljevic Spassky, World Chess Defending Champion, USSR"},{"url":"/chess/petrosian.png","caption":"Tigran Petrosian, Former World Chess Champion, USSR"},{"url":"/chess/newspaper.png","caption":"Newspaper headline indicating the increase of prize fund money"}]},{"id":6,"title":"Game 6","subtype":"Queen\'s Gambit Declined: Tartakower Defense, Exchange variation (D59)","date":"1972","image":"/chess/chess.png","content":["Move Order: 1.c4 e6 2.Nf3 d5 3.d4 Nf6 4.Nc3 Be7 5.Bg5 0-0 6.e3 h6 7.Bh4 b6 8.cxd5 Nxd5 9.Bxe7 Qxe7 10.Nxd5 exd5 11.Rc1 Be6 12.Qa4 c5 13.Qa3 Rc8 14.Bb5 a6 15.dxc5 bxc5 16.0-0 Ra7 17.Be2 Nd7 18.Nd4 Qf8 19.Nxe6 fxe6 20.e4 d4 21.f4 Qe7 22.e5 Rb8 23.Bc4 Kh8 24.Qh3 Nf8 25.b3 a5 26.f5 exf5 27.Rxf5 Nh7 28.Rcf1 Qd8 29.Qg3 Re7 30.h4 Rbb7 31.e6 Rbc7 32.Qe5 Qe8 33.a4 Qd8 34.R1f2 Qe8 35.R2f3 Qd8 36.Bd3 Qe8 37.Qe4 Nf6 38.Rxf6 gxf6 39.Rxf6 Kg8 40.Bc4 Kh8 41.Qf4 1 \u2013 0","Before game 5, It was rumored (from Svetozar Gligoric) that Fischer had put almost 14 new demands to the Icelandic chess federation which included among other things: fresh American newspapers everyday, a smaller chess board on which to play on, a toggle switch of all of the cameras filming the game, a new Mercedes car, and exclusive use of the hotel swimming pool where Fischer would be able to relax away from everyone else. All of these demands were not met by the Icelandic chess federation, but Fischer decided to play on. Spassky\'s seconds also advocated for a rest day before the game while Fischer sorted out his demands, but Spassky himself refused because he would have the white pieces to come and play for a win. Game 5 was another critical game in the 1972 World Chess Championship since a win would tie Fischer with Spassky in terms of points and would be another crushing defeat for the Soviet Chess Federation if Spassky lost with the white pieces. The game was played on the main stage in the playing hall.","Spassky opens with d4 which is the typical Spassky Queen\'s pawn opening. Fischer replies Nf6 and Spassky plays c4 transposing into the Queen\'s gambit game with an intention to play into a Nimzo-Indian defense. Fischer plays e6 and Spassky plays Nc3 which is standard theory of the Queen\'s Gambit declined and Fischer goes for the Nimzo-Indian with Bb4. Spassky plays Nf3 (the future Kasparov variation) which allows Fischer to decide which line of the Nimzo-Indian the game will follow. Fischer challenges the center and Spassky\'s d4 pawn with c5 which entices e3 to be played (Huebner variation). Spassky obliges and plays e3 and Fischer goes for Nc6. Spassky develops his light squared bishop with Bd3 and Fischer, as is standard in the Nimzo-Indian, captures Spassky\'s knight on c3 with his b4 bishop. Fischer plays Bxc3 and Spassky recaptures with bxc3. This recapture messes up white\'s pawn structure and may become a potential weakness later in the game. Fischer strengthens his c5 pawn with d6 and Spassky plays e4 which gains nice control over the center. Fischer instinctively plays e5 and Spassky closes the center with d5. Fischer moves his inactive knight on c6 to e7 (Ne7) which will allow the knight to defend the black kingside. Spassky plays an excellent move with Nh4 with intentions of playing Nf5 in the future to attack Fischer\'s kingside if there is a kingside castle. Fischer also plays an excellent counter with h6 preparing to play g5 to kick the white h4 knight away and prevent an f4 idea by Spassky. Spassky, at this point, spends 25 minutes contemplating his next move and he pushes f4. Fischer instantly plays the best move in the position which is Ng6 which attacks the f4 pawn and challenging the knight on h4. Spassky decides to eliminate the g6 knight and plays Nxg6 with Fischer recapturing with fxg6. Spassky grabs a pawn with fxe5 and Fischer recaptures with dxe5. Spassky now develops his dark squared bishop with Be3 with tempo attacking the c5 pawn. Fischer simply defends with b6 and now Spassky, in this position, can\'t really push for a win with the white pieces. Both of the white bishops are somewhat caged in and Fischer has solid pawn structures on both the kingside and queenside.","Both players castle (0-0) and on move sixteen, Spassky pushes a4 trying to start an attack on the queenside. Fischer prevents further expansion pushing a5 which locks down the queenside. Spassky plays Rb1 trying to capture the backwards b6 pawn and Fischer plays a nice move with Bd7 which develops and attacks the a4 pawn. Spassky moves Rb2 with ideas of doubling rooks on the F file and pushing on the kingside now. Fischer plays Rb8 in case Spassky doesn\'t move his rook and Spassky conversely does move his rook playing Rbf2. Fischer now involves his queen with Qe7 instead of Qc7 which would blunder the position. A potential line would be (19. Rbf2 Qc7 20. Bxh6 gxh6 21. Rxf6 Rxf6 22. Rxf6). Spassky plays Bc2 trying to remanouver the unimpressive light squared bishop to a more active square. At this point in the game, Fischer can immediately simplify by playing 21. Ng4 22. Rxf8 Rxf8 23. Rxf8 Qxf8 24. Qe2 Nxe3 25. Qxe3 24. g5 which guarantees him at least a draw with excellent play. With this imagined line, Fischer\'s kingside can\'t be penetrated unless Spassky wants to lose material and it is very hard for white to push for a win. Instead of going for the preivously mentioned drawing line, Fischer plays g5 on move 21. Spassky moves the dark squared bishop back playing Bd2 with ideas of swinging the bishop to the e1-h4 diagonal and landing it on the g3 square. Fischer plays Qe8 and Spassky continues Be1. Fischer plays Qg6 trying to get the black queen to a more active square and Spassky plays Qd3 shoring up the white center. Fischer moves Nh5 which prompts all of te rooks to be traded. Spassky plays Rxf8+ and Fischer recaptures playing Rxf8. Spassky trades again playing Rxf8+ and now Fischer recaptures with the king playing Kxf8. Spassky plays Bd1 which comes with a threat of capturing the black knight on h5. The white queen can also come to b1 to put pressure on the backwards b6 pawn and keep the black queen on the sixth rank. Fischer moves the knight from h5 to f4 (Nf4). Spassky, in time trouble, makes the move Qc2?? on move 27 which completely blunders the position for white. Following this move, Fischer played Bxa4 and Spassky immediately resigned the game.","Spassky resigned because if he played Qxa4 seemingly capturing the unguarded bishop, Fischer has Qxe4 and now there are unstoppable checkmates with Qxe1# and Qxg2#. Spassky could prolong by either moving the king to f2 or the queen to d2 but these both lose since Kf2 is an unstoppable mate in four with 28. Kf2 Nd3+ 29. Kg3 Qh3+ 30. Kf3 Qf4+ 31. Ke2 Nc1# and Qd2 would force Spassky down three pawns. The line would be 28. Qd2 Bxd1 29. Qxd1 Qxe4 30. Qd2 a4. Spassky could have easily gone into drawing lines very easily in this game, but he chose to fight for a win which cost him with Fischer\'s Bxa4.","After game 5, Fischer conveniently found his hotel swimming pool empty and relaxed there alone for the entire night in celebration of tying the match.","The score following Game 5 in the 1972 World Chess Championship is now 2.5 - 2.5 tied."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/chess/fisher.png","caption":"Robert James Fischer, World Chess Championship Challenger, USA"},{"url":"/chess/spaasky.png","caption":"Boris Vasiljevic Spassky, World Chess Defending Champion, USSR"},{"url":"/chess/petrosian.png","caption":"Tigran Petrosian, Former World Chess Champion, USSR"},{"url":"/chess/newspaper.png","caption":"Newspaper headline indicating the increase of prize fund money"}]},{"id":7,"title":"Game 7","subtype":"Sicilian Defense, Najdorf Variation, Poisoned Pawn Variation (B97)","date":"1972","image":"/chess/chess.png","content":["Move Order: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 Qb6 8.Qd2 Qxb2 9.Nb3 Qa3 10.Bd3 Be7 11.0-0 h6 12.Bh4 Nxe4 13.Nxe4 Bxh4 14.f5 exf5 15.Bb5+ axb5 16.Nxd6+ Kf8 17.Nxc8 Nc6 18.Nd6 Rd8 19.Nxb5 Qe7 20.Qf4 g6 21.a4 Bg5 22.Qc4 Be3+ 23.Kh1 f4 24.g3 g5 25.Rae1 Qb4 26.Qxb4+ Nxb4 27.Re2 Kg7 28.Na5 b6 29.Nc4 Nd5 30.Ncd6 Bc5 31.Nb7 Rc8 32.c4 Ne3 33.Rf3 Nxc4 34.gxf4 g4 35.Rd3 h5 36.h3 Na5 37.N7d6 Bxd6 38.Nxd6 Rc1+ 39.Kg2 Nc4 40.Ne8+ Kg6 41.h4 f6 42.Re6 Rc2+ 43.Kg1 Kf5 44.Ng7+ Kxf4 45.Rd4+ Kg3 46.Nf5+ Kf3 47.Ree4 Rc1+ 48.Kh2 Rc2+ 49.Kg1 \xbd - \xbd","After Fischer\'s lonely celebration in the swimming pool following Game 5, the American was extremely confident as the match was now tied. He indicated to his second (Lombardy) that he had a surprise in store for Spassky in Game 6. Spassky, on the other hand, did not seem phased and played ping pong with his team the same night of his Game 5 loss. The Soviet Chess Federation implored Spassky to prepare adequately for his future games, but he decided against this. When informed of Fischer\'s surprise for Game 6, Spassky replied that if the game transposed into a Queen\'s Gambit declined, he would play the Tartakower defense in which he had never lost a game.","Fischer opens with c4 which is a relatively new opening since he played it only once against Lev Polugaevsky at the 1970 Interzonal tournament. Spassky replies e6 and Fischer plays Nf3. Spassky strikes in the center with d5 and Fischer transposes into the Queen\'s Gambit declined with d4. Spassky plays Nf6 and Fischer plays Nc3 which is standard theory of the Queen\'s Gambit Declined. Spassky moves his dark squared bishop with Be7 and Fischer responds with an aggressive Bg5 adding pressure to Spassky\'s f6 knight and as a result, Spassky castles (0-0) to safety. Fischer activates his light squared bishop by playing e3. This move is quite common in the Rubinstein system as it allows the light squared bishop to defend the c4 pawn in the QGD. Spassky plays h6 to kick Fischer\'s dark squared bishop back and Fischer obliges playing Bh4. Spassky now plays b6 and finally the game enters the Tartakower defense of the Queen\'s Gambit Declined.","A capture fest now occurs on the board with Fischer playing cxd5 and Spassky recapturing with Nxd5. A trade of dark squared bishops occurs with Bxe7 and Qxe7. Fischer trades a pair of knights with Nxd5 and Spassky plays exd5. A common position of the Tartakower defense is reached with Fischer\'s Rc1 and Spassky develops with Be6. An alterantive could have been developing to b7 (Bb7) but a series of captures in the center could have made the bishop on the B file somewhat vulnerable to white\'s c1 rook. Fischer develops his queen playing Qa4 and Spassky strikes in the center with c5. Fischer piles up on the c5 pawn immediately with Qa3 which allows white\'s queen and rook to pin the c5 pawn. If the c5 pawn is pushed, Spassky loses his undefended queen. Spassky instead defends the c5 pawn with Rc8. Fischer now plays an excellent move with Bb5 which prevents Spassky from developing his knight to a useful square (a6, c6, and d7 are all covered by the bishop). Spassky wants to kick the powerful white light squared bishop away and thus plays a6. Fischer now plays dxc5 which keeps the pressure on the black kingside. The light squared bishop still can\'t be captured by the a6 pawn since Fischer will just pick up the black a8 rook with Qxa8. Spassky instead plays bxc5 and Fischer gets his king to safety with castles (0-0). Spassky plays Ra7 which is the problem move for black in this position. A better continutation from this position could have been Qb7 and then Qb6. However, Ra7 looks promising because the black queen defends the rook and soon axb5 will be played if Fischer doesn\'t move his bishop. Realizing this, Fischer simply moves the bishop back with Be7. Spassky now develops his knight with Nd7 and Fischer immediately capitalizes with Nd4. The problem for black with this move is that cxd4 by black is not an option as the c8 rook hangs. Spassky now plays Qf8 but this allows Fischer too much and he can now simplify the game. Fischer starts with Nxe6 eliminating black\'s light squared bishop and Spassky recaptures the white knight with fxe6.","Black\'s position now comprises of a nice pawn center but an unimpressive rook on a7 and a knight that still has to find a purpose in the game. Fischer attacks Spassky\'s pawn center with e4. Spassky now has options of either capturing on e4 with his d5 pawn or he can push d5 to d4. A capture with dxe4 is not impressive since it doubles black\'s pawns and allows Fischer to double rooks on the C file. Instead, Spassky pushes with d4 which also is not the best move which would have been c4. The move c4 is better since it offers a trade of queens and if Fischer declined with Qh3 (going after the backwards e6 pawn), Spassky easily defends with Qf7 and all is well for black. After Spassky\'s d4 push, Fischer moves f4 which is a solid move (establishing further control of the e5 square which prevents the black knight from jumping to e5 or pushing e5). Spassky plays Qe7 to defend the e6 pawn (Fischer\'s plan is to move Qh3 and Bc4 to attack the e6 pawn twice). Fischer pushes e5 which improves white\'s central control considerably. Spassky plays Rb8 to go after the white b2 pawn, but Fischer ignores this attack instead playing Bc4. Spassky moves his king away from the white bishop\'s diagonal with Kh8 and Fischer plays Qh3 establishing the double attack on the e6 pawn. Spassky defends with Nf8 and Fischer improves with b3. Now the white B pawn is defended by the a2 pawn. Spassky pushes a5 hoping to break open the white kingside but Fischer intends to break black\'s position with f5. Spassky captures with exf5 and Fischer recaptures with Rxf5.","Spassky now remanouvers his knight with Nh7 with the intention of playing Ng5. Nh7 also comes with poison in the position since if white plays Rf7 with an attack on the queen and maybe winning the a7 rook if the queen moves, Spassky could play Ng5 with a fork on the rook and queen. Fischer would capture the black queen with Rxe7 and Spassky would capture the white queen with Nxh3+ and now white loses a tempo with the check. The line would look like 27.Rxf5 Nh7 28. Rf7 Ng5 29. Rxe7 Nxh3+. Fischer instead smartly doubles rooks with Rcf1 and Spassky plays Qd8 which gets the queen away from threats on the seventh rank (Rf7). Fischer plays another excellent move with Qg3 which introduces checkmating ideas into the position. Spassky now has to prevent white\'s passed E pawn from being pushed and plays Re7. Fischer prevents the black knight from jumping to g5 by playing h4. Spassky plays Rbb7 which adds another defender to the seventh rank and Fischer pushes his passed E pawn with e6. Spassky defends with c5 pawn with Rbc7. Fischer now centralizes his queen with Qe5 preparing to further push the passed E pawn. Spassky must add more defenders and does with Qe8. Black\'s position is now being boxed in by white. Fischer plays a4 and now black is in zugzwang. Spassky must repeat moves to keep the game going with Qd8 and Fischer improves his backwards rook with R1f2. Spassky repeats with Qe8 and Fischer now plays R2f3. Spassky once again plays Qe8 and now Fischer starts his new attack with Bd3 aligning the bishop with the black h7 knight. Spassky once again plays Qe8 and Fischer creates a queen-bishop battery with Qe4.","Spassky now plays Nf6 but Fischer captures playing Rxf6. Spassky recaptures the rook with gxf6 and Fischer reacptures with Rxf6. Spassky now moves his king with Kg8. Fischer moves Bc4 and now black is completely lost. Spassky played Kh8 and Fischer played Qf4. Following this move, Spassky resigned the game as the threat of Rf8+ by white wins on the spot (black loses the queen). After winning Game 6, Fischer now takes the lead over Spassky. Following Spassky\'s resignation, the spectators watching in the playing hall rose and up and gave a standing ovation for Fischer beating Spassky in the Tartakower defense. Spassky also stood up and applauded Fischer for his brilliant win. Fischer was overwhelmed by Spassky\'s sportsmanship and left the playing hall immediately.","The score following Game 6 in the 1972 World Chess Championship is now 3.5 - 2.5 in favor of Fischer."],"imageUrls":[{"url":"/chess/fisher.png","caption":"Robert James Fischer, World Chess Championship Challenger, USA"},{"url":"/chess/spaasky.png","caption":"Boris Vasiljevic Spassky, World
