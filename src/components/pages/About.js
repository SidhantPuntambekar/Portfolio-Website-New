          ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Sidhant Puntambekar. Welcome to my corner of the internet!

        <h4 style={{ margin: "20px", lineHeight: "1.5" }}>
          Academically, I find computer science and molecular biology to not only be extremely fascinating as separate disciplines, but also tremendously interconnected as novel algorithms and computational workflows are needed to make sense of increasingly complex and unstructured biological data.     
        </h4>
        <h4 h4 style={{ margin: "20px", lineHeight: "1.5" }}>
        While I mainly spend most of my time working and researching at the intersection of these two fields, I also enjoy learning about all sorts of topics in science, technology, engineering, math, history, and geography.

        <h4 style={{ margin: "20px", lineHeight: "1.5"}}>
          Currently, I am employed as a bioinformatics analyst and software developer at Bionano Genomics in San Diego, California.
          Although I call San Diego home for the moment, I am originally from Boulder, Colorado.
        </h4>
        <h4 style={{ margin: "20px", lineHeight: "1.5" }} class="text-red-500">
          I also have a wide variety of hobbies that I pursue in my spare time; I enjoy playing chess and studying games of the past to improve my own skills, playing musical instruments including the electric guitar and piano, 
          reading about various military history topics, learning languages such as Spanish and German, running, travelling around the world, and following Denver area sports teams (such as the <span style={{color: "orange"}}>Broncos</span>, <span style={{color: "yellow"}}>Nuggets</span>, <span style={{color: "#FF2400"}}>Avalanche</span>, and <span style={{color: "#C0C0C0"}}>Rockies</span>).
          Recently, I also started following Formula 1 racing.
